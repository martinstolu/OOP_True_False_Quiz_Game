üß† True or False Quiz Game
A simple command-line True or False Quiz App built with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python. The game pulls a list of questions and quizzes the user one at a time, tracking their score as they go.

üöÄ How It Works
A list of trivia questions is stored in data.py

Each question is turned into a Question object from question_model.py

The QuizBrain class in quiz_brain.py handles the flow of the quiz (asking questions, checking answers, keeping score)

The main logic to run the app is in main.py
